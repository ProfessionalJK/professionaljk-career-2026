# Merge Intervals

This project provides implementations of the Merge Intervals algorithm in both Python and Java.

## Overview

The Merge Intervals algorithm takes a list of intervals and merges all overlapping intervals into one.

## Languages

- Python
- Java

## Usage

Refer to the respective language folders for implementation details and usage examples.

## Examples
Given the intervals: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
The merged intervals would be: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

Given the intervals: `[[1,4],[4,5]]`
The merged intervals would be: `[[1,5]]`
